				Narayana Guru, also known as Sree Narayana Guru (c. 1856 â€“ 20 September 1928) was a social reformer of India. He was born into a Kerala family in an era when people from such communities, which were regarded as Avarna, faced much social injustice in the caste-ridden society of Kerala. 
				</p>
				<p>
				He led a reform movement in Kerala, rejected casteism, and promoted new values of spiritual freedom and social equality.[1] He stressed the need for the spiritual and social uplift of the downtrodden by their own efforts through the establishment of temples and educational institutions. 
				</p>
				<p>
				In the process, he denounced the superstitions that clouded the fundamental Hindu cultural convention of caste.

				Ganesha emerged as a distinct deity in the 4th and 5th centuries AD, during the Gupta period, although he inherited traits from Vedic and pre-Vedic precursors.
				</p>
				<p>
				He was formally included among the five primary deities of Smartism (a Hindu denomination) in the 9th century. A sect of devotees called the Ganapatya arose, who identified Ganesha as the supreme deity.
				</p>
				<p>
				The principal scriptures dedicated to Ganesha are the Ganesha Purana, the Mudgala Purana, and the Ganapati Atharvashirsa. Brahma Purana and Brahmanda Purana are other two Puranic genre encyclopedic texts that deal with Ganesha.
